# 🚀 My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository.  
This website is a curated showcase of my **skills, projects, and engineering mindset**, presented through a clean, modern interface with interactive elements and a strong Web3 focus.

The goal of this portfolio is simple:  
**show real skills, real projects, and real problem-solving — not just visuals.**
